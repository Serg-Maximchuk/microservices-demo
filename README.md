Microservices demo

Each service have it's own docker file and depends on a jar file of the service.
Create it by running `gradle bootJar` command for each service.

Before we start, make sure you've already done this:

`sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER`

## Config service
Config service lives in directory `config`.
To start with, execute the below command in config directory to create the base Docker image:

`docker build --tag=config-server:latest --rm=true .`

Then run it:

`docker run --name=config-server --publish=9090:9090 config-server:latest`

If you receive 404 error with this: "Cannot clone or checkout repository", fix your docker networking as described here:
