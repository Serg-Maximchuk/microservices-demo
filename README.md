Microservices demo

Each service have it's own docker file and depends on a jar file of the service.
Create it by running `gradle bootJar` command for each service.

Before we start, make sure you've already done this:

`sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER`

If you receive 404 error with this: "Cannot clone or checkout repository" for config service,
fix your docker networking as described here:

## Running containers together

Docker compose is used for this. Install it if not yet:

`sudo apt-get install python-pip`

`sudo pip install --upgrade pip`

`sudo apt-get install -y python-setuptools`

`sudo pip install docker-compose`

And from project root folder: `docker-compose up --build`.

Check these URLs:

`http://localhost:9090/config/default` to check configuratio

`http://localhost:9091/` is for service discovery

`http://localhost:8081/dashboard/feign/peers` is user dashboard

`http://localhost:8084/usersUI/dashboard/feign/1` is a gateway for user dashboard

`http://localhost:8080/users/1` is direct access for user service
